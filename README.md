# Tarot Card Memory Game

This project was created as an assignment for The Odin Project's React course.  Pick a card, any card.  Each time a card is picked, the cards shuffle randomly.  Each unique card picked gets you 1 point.  The game ends when you choose a card that has been previously chosen.  Are you a mental master with the ability to choose all 12 cards?
